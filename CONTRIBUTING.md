# Contributing to G-man

First off, thank you for considering contributing to G-man! It’s people like you who make it a great tool for the Steam automation community.

By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms and follow the coding standards outlined below.

## 🟢 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

* **Check the Issues:** Search the existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported.
* **Provide Details:** Use a clear and descriptive title. Include steps to reproduce, the expected behavior, and what actually happened.
* **Environment:** Mention your Go version, OS, and any specific Steam environment details (e.g., "WebSockets connection in China realm").

### Suggesting Enhancements

* **Open an Issue:** Describe the feature you'd like to see and, most importantly, **why** it would be useful for the project.
* **Scope & Generality:** G-man is designed to be a highly universal, modular foundation suitable for a wide range of trading setups, service platforms, and private bot managers.
  * **Keep it Generic:** We do **not** accept highly specialized business logic, proprietary rules, or overly narrow database schemas that are tailored for a single private trading system.
  * **Build on Top, Not Inside:** Public APIs, structures, and managers must remain customizable and generic. Custom, proprietary trading algorithms or private backend integrations should be built *on top* of G-man modules using our decoupled interfaces rather than being merged directly into the core packages.
  * **Game-Specific Logic:** Core packages (`pkg/steam`, `pkg/trading/engine`, etc.) must remain completely agnostic to individual game attributes. Game-specific operations belong either in the `pkg/steam/sys/gc` coordinators or in external extension libraries (like `g-man-tf2`).

### Pull Requests

* **Fork and Branch:** Create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/market-history` or `fix/totp-alignment`).
* **Atomic Commits:** Keep your commits small and focused.
* **Tests:** Every new feature or bug fix **must** include corresponding tests.
* **Documentation:** Update the `README.md` or `doc.go` files if you are changing the public API.

## 🛠 Development Standards

G-man is built with a focus on high performance and maintainability. We follow standard Go idioms and some project-specific rules.

### 1. Code Style

* **Formatting:** All code must be formatted with `gofmt` (or `goimports`).
* **Linting:** We use `golangci-lint`. Please run it before submitting a PR.
* **Naming:** Use `camelCase` for internal variables and `PascalCase` for exported ones. Avoid stuttering (e.g., use `auth.Client` instead of `auth.AuthClient`).

### 2. Concurrency & State

* **No Global State:** Global variables are strictly forbidden. Use structs and pass dependencies through constructors.
* **Mutexes:** Keep critical sections as small as possible. Prefer `atomic` values for simple counters or state flags.
* **Contexts:** Always propagate `context.Context` through blocking calls (Network, I/O, Long-running loops).
* **Event-Driven Patterns:** Avoid blocking downstream services or holding long synchronous locks. Use the thread-safe `pkg/bus` to emit status changes (e.g., a state change should publish an event rather than directly calling a hard-coded handler in another package).

### 3. Error Handling

* **Wrap Errors:** Use `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` to provide trace-like context to errors.
* **Typed Errors:** For common failure modes (like "Rate Limit" or "Not Logged In"), use the predefined errors in `pkg/steam/api`.

### 4. Interfaces

* **Consumer-Defined:** Define interfaces where the logic is *consumed* as a dependency, not where it is implemented.
* **Small Interfaces:** Follow the Single Responsibility Principle. `io.Reader` is a great example—keep your interfaces lean.

### 5. Logging

* **Structured Only:** Do not use `fmt.Println` or the standard `log` package. Use the `pkg/log` package provided in the SDK.
* **Contextual Fields:** Always include relevant metadata using fields (e.g., `log.SteamID(id)`).

### 6. Modules & Topological Bootstrapping

* **Embed `module.Base`:** Any new module intended to be managed by the core client must embed `module.Base` (or implement the module lifecycle interface).
* **Deterministic Initialization:** Avoid complex logic or external network calls in constructors (`New...`). Offload startup logic to the `Start(ctx)` lifecycle method.
* **Avoid Circular Dependencies:** Because G-man uses a DFS algorithm to topologically sort modules during boot, check your imports. A circular dependency between modules will cause a fast-fail during client startup.

### 7. Network and Transport

* **Use `transport.Doer`:** Never instantiate or use standard `http.DefaultClient` or custom raw HTTP clients directly for Steam interactions. All HTTP and socket traffic must route through the `transport.Doer` interface. This ensures that:
  * Proxy settings (SOCKS5/HTTP) are respected globally.
  * WebSession silent re-authentication can intercept and refresh expired cookies.
  * Requests can be easily mocked in unit tests.

### 8. Defensive Web Scraping (Community Scrapers)

If you are contributing to the `pkg/steam/community` package:
* **No Blind Status Checks:** Do not assume a `200 OK` HTTP status means the request succeeded. Always scan the raw response body for Steam's warning blocks.
* **Convert to Strongly-Typed Errors:** If a soft error is detected, convert it into a strictly typed error defined in `pkg/steam/api` (e.g., `ErrRateLimited` or `ErrSessionExpired`), allowing safety handlers and re-auth loops to trigger.

## 📦 Dependency Policy

We strive to keep the dependency tree as lean as possible.

* **Standard Library First:** Always prefer the Go standard library if it can achieve the task efficiently.
* **Justification:** Adding a new external dependency requires a strong justification in the PR description.
* **License Compatibility:** New dependencies must have a permissive license (MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0).

## 💬 Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

* `feat:` for new features (e.g., `feat(tf2): add automatic scrap combining`).
* `fix:` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix(socket): resolve race condition in heartbeat`).
* `docs:` for documentation changes.
* `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.

## 🧪 Testing

We rely heavily on automated testing to ensure the framework remains stable.

* **Mocking:** Use the `test/` package to mock network requesters and Steam CM responses.
* **Race Detector:** Always run your tests with the race detector enabled: `go test -race ./...`.

## 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability (especially related to Steam Guard or credential handling), please **do not open a public issue**. Instead, please contact the maintainers privately at `arsenii.komolov@yandex.ru` (or via Telegram: `t.me/LemonadeAK`).
