Package bus implements a type-based event bus for asynchronous communication.

It provides a decoupled architecture where components can publish and
subscribe to typed events without direct dependencies.

# Key Components

  - [Bus]: The central thread-safe coordinator that routes events.
  - [Event]: The marker interface implemented by embedding BaseEvent.
  - [Subscription]: The consumer handle providing an event channel.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"sync"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/bus"
	)

	type MyEvent struct {
		bus.BaseEvent
		Message string
	}

	func main() {
		b := bus.New()
		sub := b.Subscribe(MyEvent{})
		defer sub.Unsubscribe()

		var wg sync.WaitGroup

		wg.Go(func() {
			for ev := range sub.C() {
				msg := ev.(MyEvent).Message
				fmt.Println("Received:", msg)
			}
		})

		b.Publish(MyEvent{Message: "Hello!"})
		b.Close() // Closes all subscription channels, letting the goroutine exit.
		wg.Wait()
	}
