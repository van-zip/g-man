Package pkg contains the public API surface of the G-man framework.

The G-man SDK is a modular, high-performance ecosystem for building automated
Steam entities, ranging from simple WebAPI-based tools to complex, stateful
trading bots.

# Architecture Layers

The framework is organized into five logical layers to ensure separation of
concerns and scalability:

 1. Core Layer (pkg/steam): The foundation. Handles low-level network communication,
    protocol serialization (Protobuf/VDF/JSON), and authentication. Key packages
    include 'socket' for CM connections and 'transport' for protocol agnosticism.

 2. System Layer (pkg/steam/sys): Manages internal Steam subsystems, such as
    the Game Coordinator (GC) gateway and the Steam Directory client for
    dynamic server discovery.

 3. Trading Logic (pkg/trading): A high-level engine for automated trading.
    It features a middleware-based "Onion" architecture for request validation
    and a stateful processor for trade lifecycles.

 4. Infrastructure: Common utilities like 'storage' (SQLite/JSON/Memory),
    'bus' (event-driven communication), and 'crypto' (Steam-specific TOTP).

# Core Philosophy

Interface-Driven Design: Most components interact through interfaces like
service.Doer or transport.Target. This allows for easy mocking in tests
and flexible implementation swaps.

Protocol Agnosticism: Through the service.Client, the SDK automatically decides
the best route for a request—preferring an active Socket connection for speed,
but falling back to HTTP if necessary.

Concurrency and Atomic State: Core subsystems are designed for high-throughput.
State management (sessions, job IDs, connection status) relies on atomic
operations and RWMutexes to ensure thread safety without sacrificing performance.

Smart Error Handling: The SDK distinguishes between transport-level failures
and Steam "Soft Errors" (e.g., an HTML error page returning a 200 OK status).
These are automatically converted into typed Go errors for reliable handling.

# Usage Guidelines

  - Context Support: Every blocking or network-bound operation accepts a
    context.Context for proper cancellation and timeout management.
  - No Global State: Subsystems must be initialized via constructors (e.g., NewClient)
    with explicit dependency injection.
  - Module System: Use the 'steam.RegisterModule' interface to extend the
    orchestrator with custom logic.

repository root.
