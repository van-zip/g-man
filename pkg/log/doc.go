Package log provides a high-performance, asynchronous, structured logger
designed for both human readability and machine efficiency.

The logger uses a non-blocking architecture where log messages are formatted
in the calling goroutine and then sent to a background worker via a fixed-size
buffer (channel). This ensures that logging operations have minimal impact
on the latency of the main application logic.

# Key Components

  - [Logger]: The primary interface that defines all structured logging methods.
  - [Field]: A key-value pair used to represent structured context.
  - [Config]: Controls the output destination, severity level, and visual style of the logger.
  - [AsyncLogger]: The default thread-safe, non-blocking implementation of the [Logger] interface.

# Basic Usage (Asynchronous Text Logger)

	package main

	import (
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/log"
	)

	func main() {
		// Initialize default configuration
		cfg := log.DefaultConfig(log.LevelInfo)
		logger := log.New(cfg)
		defer logger.Close()

		// Log messages with structured context
		logger.Info("user logged in",
			log.String("username", "john_doe"),
			log.Int("attempts", 3),
		)
	}
