Package auth implements the complex, multi-stage authentication logic required to establish a secure session with Steam.

# Key Components

  - [Authenticator]: The primary orchestrator that negotiates the secure handshake and logon phase with Steam CMs.
  - [AuthenticationService]: A gateway for Steam's modern Unified WebAPI authentication endpoints.
  - [LogOnDetails]: Holds credential parameters, refresh tokens, and device identifiers used during authentication.
  - [Store]: An interface used to persist authentication states (such as tokens and machine IDs).
  - [DeviceConfig]: Allows customizing how the client presents its hardware profile to Steam.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/auth"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/service"
		tr "github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/transport"
	)

	func main() {
		ctx := context.Background()

		// Prepare HTTP transport wrapping the WebAPI base
		transport := tr.NewHTTPTransport(nil, service.WebAPIBase)
		serviceClient := service.New(transport)

		// Create a new authentication service
		authSvc := auth.NewAuthenticationService(serviceClient, nil)

		// Retrieve the public key for an account
		resp, err := authSvc.GetPasswordRSAPublicKey(ctx, "steam_user")
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to retrieve public key:", err)
			return
		}

		fmt.Println("Timestamp of key:", resp.GetTimestamp())
	}
