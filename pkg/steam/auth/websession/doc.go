Package websession provides a high-level interface for managing Steam web sessions.

It automates the process of obtaining and synchronizing authentication cookies
('steamLoginSecure' and 'sessionid') across multiple Steam domains such as
steamcommunity.com and steampowered.com.

# Key Components

- [WebSession]: The primary manager of cookie jars and session-authenticated HTTP clients.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/log"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/auth/websession"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/id"
	)

	func main() {
		logger := log.New(log.DefaultConfig(log.LevelInfo))
		steamID := id.Parse("76561197960265728")

		// Create a new web session
		ws := websession.New(steamID, logger, nil)

		// Retrieve the initialized sessionid cookie value
		sessionID := ws.SessionID("https://steamcommunity.com")
		fmt.Println("Initial SessionID:", sessionID)
	}
