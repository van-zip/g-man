Package community provides a high-level client for the steamcommunity.com website.

Unlike the structured service package which uses official WebAPIs, this
package interacts with the web side of Steam. This includes parsing HTML pages,
performing AJAX calls, and handling legacy form-encoded data.

# Key Components

  - [Client]: The primary client used to communicate with Steam Community pages.
  - [Requester]: An interface representing objects capable of executing HTTP requests with session support.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/community"
	)

	func main() {
		ctx := context.Background()

		// Mock sessionID extractor returning a dummy token
		sessionFunc := func(url string) string {
			return "mock_session_id_12345"
		}

		// Create a new Community Client wrapping the default HTTP transport
		client := community.NewClient(nil, sessionFunc)

		// Perform a GET request to fetch raw HTML content
		htmlBytes, err := community.GetHTML(ctx, client, "dev")
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Request failed:", err)
			return
		}

		fmt.Printf("Successfully retrieved %d bytes of HTML\n", len(htmlBytes))
	}
