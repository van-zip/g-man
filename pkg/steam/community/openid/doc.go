Package openid provides automated OpenID authentication for third-party websites
that use "Sign in through Steam".

It manages CookieJars and executes the OpenID claim assertion flow on Steam Community.

# Basic Usage Example

package main

import (

	"context"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"github.com/lemon4ksan/aoni"
	"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/community/openid"

)

	func main() {
		ctx := context.Background()
		// Active Steam cookies retrieved from auth.WebSession
		var activeCookies []*http.Cookie
		// Authorize and retrieve a session-authenticated client
		client, err := openid.Login(ctx, "https://csgo-trading-site.com/login", activeCookies)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Login failed:", err)
			return
		}
		// Now use the client to perform requests to the third-party site
		_ = client
	}
