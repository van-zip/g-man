Package steam provides the high-level, unified orchestrator (Client) for interacting
with all aspects of the Steam ecosystem.

# Key Components

  - [Client]: The central coordinator that manages socket connections, session lifecycles, and module registration.
  - [SocketProvider]: Defines the minimal socket operations required to maintain a connection to Steam CMs.
  - [Config]: Aggregates configurations for all underlying systems (Socket, Storage, HTTP).
  - [State]: Represents the current lifecycle stage of the high-level client.

# Architecture

The [Client] acts as an orchestrator, connecting the low-level socket, auth manager,
web session, and individual domain modules. It implements [service.Doer],
dynamically routing requests over TCP/WebSockets or HTTP depending on connection state.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/log"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/storage/memory"
	)

	func main() {
		ctx := context.Background()
		logger := log.New(log.DefaultConfig(log.LevelInfo))

		// Build the standard configuration
		cfg := steam.DefaultConfig()
		cfg.Storage = memory.New()

		// Create a new Steam client
		client, err := steam.NewClient(cfg, steam.WithLogger(logger))
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to create client:", err)
			return
		}
		defer client.Close()

		// Run the client's internal background systems
		if err := client.Run(); err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to run client:", err)
			return
		}
	}
