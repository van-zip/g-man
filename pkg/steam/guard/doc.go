Package guard implements the logic for handling Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator confirmations.

This module automates the process of fetching, parsing, and acting upon mobile
confirmations, which are required for market listings and trade offers when
two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled.

# Key Components

  - [Guardian]: The central module manager that coordinates Steam Guard actions and generates TOTP codes.
  - [Confirmation]: Represents a single pending mobile confirmation on Steam.
  - [Clock]: An interface used to synchronize local time with Steam server time.
  - [ConfService]: An interface used to communicate with Steam's mobile confirmation endpoints.
  - [Config]: Defines configuration options including shared secrets and device identifiers.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/guard"
	)

	func main() {
		cfg := guard.DefaultConfig()
		cfg.SharedSecret = "base64SharedSecret=="
		cfg.DeviceID = "android:8ff408c4-e869-42b7-a36a-2d9d1be64889"

		g, err := guard.New(cfg)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Initialization failed:", err)
			return
		}

		code, err := g.GenerateAuthCode()
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to generate code:", err)
			return
		}

		fmt.Println("Steam Guard Code:", code)
	}
