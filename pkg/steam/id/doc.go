Package id provides utilities for parsing, validating, and converting SteamIDs.

It supports converting identifiers between standard legacy formats (Steam2, Steam3, AccountID)
and the 64-bit SteamID representation.

# Key Components

  - [ID]: The primary, thread-safe 64-bit representation of a Steam identifier.
  - [Universe]: Defines the target Steam network universe (such as Public or Dev).
  - [AccountType]: Specifies the classification of the account (such as Individual or Clan).

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/id"
	)

	func main() {
		// Parse a legacy Steam2 format ID
		steamID := id.Parse("STEAM_0:0:42063864")
		if !steamID.IsValid() {
			fmt.Println("Invalid SteamID")
			return
		}

		fmt.Println("SteamID64:", steamID.String())
		fmt.Println("Steam3:", steamID.Steam3())
	}
