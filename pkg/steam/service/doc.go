Package service provides a high-level RPC-like commander for interacting with Steam's official interfaces.

It abstracts the three primary ways to communicate with Steam: WebAPI, Unified Services,
and legacy EMsg-based socket requests.

# Key Components

  - [Client]: The primary entry point that decorates a [tr.Transport] with session credentials and validations.
  - [Doer]: An interface representing objects capable of executing transport-agnostic requests.
  - [UnifiedTarget]: Represents a modern Protobuf-based Steam Service method call.
  - [WebAPITarget]: Represents a classic JSON/VDF WebAPI call.
  - [LegacyTarget]: Represents a raw EMsg-based message used in socket connections.
  - [HTTPTarget]: A basic implementation of the transport Target interface for HTTP-based calls.
  - [SteamAPIError]: A structured error container that captures raw API response failures.
  - [EResultError]: An error wrapper around Steam's internal EResult enum codes.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/service"
		tr "github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/transport"
	)

	type ResolveVanityURLResponse struct {
		SteamID string `json:"steamid" url:"steamid"`
		Success int    `json:"success" url:"success"`
	}

	func main() {
		ctx := context.Background()

		// Initialize HTTP transport with a base URL
		transport := tr.NewHTTPTransport(nil, service.WebAPIBase)

		// Create a Service Client wrapping the transport
		client := service.New(transport).WithAPIKey("WEB_API_KEY")

		// Prepare query parameters
		reqMsg := struct {
			VanityURL string `url:"vanityurl"`
		}{VanityURL: "lemon4ksan"}

		// Call the classic WebAPI method
		resp, err := service.WebAPI[ResolveVanityURLResponse](
			ctx, client, "GET", "ISteamUser", "ResolveVanityURL", 1, reqMsg,
		)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("API call failed:", err)
			return
		}

		fmt.Println("Resolved SteamID:", resp.SteamID)
	}
