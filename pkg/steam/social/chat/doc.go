Package chat manages one-on-one friend messages and Steam group chats.

It provides real-time chat capabilities, tracks online friend typing status,
and automates message history synchronization.

# Key Components

  - [Chat]: The central module manager that coordinates sending and receiving chat messages.
  - [MessageEvent]: Emitted when a new plain-text message is received from a friend.
  - [GroupMessageEvent]: Emitted when a new message is posted in a group chatroom.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/bus"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/social/chat"
	)

	func main() {
		eventBus := bus.New()

		// Subscribe to friend message events
		sub := eventBus.Subscribe(&chat.MessageEvent{})
		defer sub.Unsubscribe()

		fmt.Println("Listening for chat messages...")
		for ev := range sub.C() {
			msgEvent := ev.(*chat.MessageEvent)
			fmt.Printf("Received message from %d: %s\n", msgEvent.SenderID, msgEvent.Message)
		}
	}
