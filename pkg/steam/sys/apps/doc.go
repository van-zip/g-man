Package apps manages the user's "In-Game" presence on Steam.

This module allows the bot to appear as if it is playing one or more games,
including non-Steam shortcuts with custom names.

# Key Components

  - [Apps]: The central module manager that coordinates playing status updates and player count queries.
  - [AppLaunchedEvent]: Emitted when the client starts playing a new game.
  - [AppQuitEvent]: Emitted when the client stops playing a game.
  - [PlayingStateEvent]: Emitted when Steam notifies about a change in playing session state.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/log"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/sys/apps"
	)

	func main() {
		ctx := context.Background()
		logger := log.New(log.DefaultConfig(log.LevelInfo))

		// Build standard client config
		clientCfg := steam.DefaultConfig()
		client, err := steam.NewClient(clientCfg, steam.WithLogger(logger))
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to create client:", err)
			return
		}
		defer client.Close()

		// Initialize the apps module
		a := apps.New()
		client.RegisterModule(a)

		// Run client systems
		if err := client.Run(); err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to run client:", err)
			return
		}

		// Set playing status to Team Fortress 2 (AppID: 440)
		err = a.PlayGames(ctx, []uint32{440}, false)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to set playing status:", err)
			return
		}

		fmt.Println("Successfully set status to In-Game!")
	}
