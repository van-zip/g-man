Package gc provides a multiplexing gateway for communicating with Steam's Game Coordinators (GC).

It acts as a smart pipe, wrapping raw game messages in the required Steam CM envelope
and routing incoming responses.

# Key Components

  - [Coordinator]: The central module manager that coordinates sending and calling GC-level requests.
  - [GCPacket]: Represents a parsed Game Coordinator message.
  - [MessageEvent]: Emitted when an unhandled Game Coordinator packet is received.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/protocol"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/steam/sys/gc"
	)

	func main() {
		g := gc.New()

		// Register a GC message handler for Team Fortress 2 (AppID: 440)
		// and custom message type (e.g. 1001)
		g.RegisterGCHandler(440, 1001, func(packet *protocol.GCPacket) {
			fmt.Printf("Received GC packet of type %d, length: %d\n", packet.MsgType, len(packet.Payload))
		})

		fmt.Println("GC Handler registered successfully")
	}
