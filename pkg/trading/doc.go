  - [Item]: Represents a specific Steam inventory item defined by its asset and class identifiers.
  - [OfferParams]: Configures parameters for creating and sending a new trade offer.
  - [CounterParams]: Holds parameters required to send a counter-offer.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (

		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/trading"
	)

	func main() {
		partnerID := id.FromAccountID(12345678)

		// Create parameters for a new trade offer
		_ = trading.OfferParams{
			PartnerID: partnerID,
			Token:     "trade_token_abc",
			Message:   "Here is your traded item!",
			ItemsToGive: []*trading.Item{
