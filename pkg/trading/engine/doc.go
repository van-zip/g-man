Package engine implements a high-performance, middleware-based reasoning system for Steam trade offers.

It follows the "Chain of Responsibility" (Onion) pattern, similar to modern web frameworks.

# Key Components

  - [Engine]: The central orchestrator that registers middleware and executes the reasoning pipeline.
  - [TradeContext]: Carries the state, metadata, and decision verdict of a single trade offer as it passes through the pipeline.
  - [Middleware]: A function type representing an isolated check or step in the reasoning pipeline.
  - [Verdict]: Holds the final action and justification returned by the reasoning engine.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/trading"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/trading/engine"
	)

	func main() {
		ctx := context.Background()
		eng := engine.New()

		// Register a basic middleware that declines empty offers
		eng.Use(func(next engine.Handler) engine.Handler {
			return func(c *engine.TradeContext) error {
				if len(c.Offer.ItemsToGive) > 0 && len(c.Offer.ItemsToReceive) == 0 {
					c.Decline("begging")
					return nil // Short-circuit: do not call next(c)
				}
				return next(c)
			}
		})

		// Prepare a fake offer
		offer := &trading.TradeOffer{
			ID:             12345,
			ItemsToGive:    []*trading.Item{{AssetID: 111}},
			ItemsToReceive: []*trading.Item{},
		}

		// Process the offer
		verdict, err := eng.Process(ctx, offer)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Processing failed:", err)
			return
		}

		fmt.Printf("Decision: Action=%s, Reason=%s\n", verdict.Action, verdict.Reason)
	}
