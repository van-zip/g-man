Package live manages real-time trade invitations via the Steam Connection Manager (CM).

Unlike the web variant which polls for asynchronous trade offers, this
module handles the immediate, pop-up style trade requests that occur when
two users are online and agree to trade live.

# Key Components

  - [Manager]: The central service that orchestrates live trade invitations, responses, and session state.
  - [TradeProposedEvent]: Emitted via the event bus when an incoming live trade request is received.
  - [TradeResultEvent]: Emitted via the event bus when a trade proposal is answered or fails.
  - [TradeSessionStartedEvent]: Emitted via the event bus when a live trade window successfully opens.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/log"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/trading/live"
	)

	func main() {
		ctx := context.Background()
		logger := log.New(log.DefaultConfig(log.LevelInfo))

		// Create a new live trade manager
		manager := live.New()
		partnerID := uint64(76561198000000000)

		// Send invitation
		err := manager.Invite(ctx, partnerID)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println("Failed to send invitation:", err)
			return
		}
		fmt.Println("Trade invitation sent to:", partnerID)
	}
