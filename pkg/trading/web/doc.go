Package web manages asynchronous trade offers via the Steam WebAPI.

# Key Components

  - [Manager]: The central coordinator that polls for sent and received trade offers, managing their states.
  - [Config]: Configures parameters for polling intervals, language settings, and auto-cancellation limits.
  - [NewOfferEvent]: Emitted via the event bus when a new, active trade offer is received.
  - [OfferChangedEvent]: Emitted via the event bus when a tracked offer's transactional state changes.

# Basic Usage Example

	package main

	import (
		"context"
		"fmt"
		"time"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/bus"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/log"
		"github.com/lemon4ksan/g-man/pkg/trading/web"
	)

	func main() {
		logger := log.New(log.DefaultConfig(log.LevelInfo))
		eventBus := bus.New()

		// Build the configuration
		cfg := web.DefaultConfig()
		cfg.PollInterval = 10 * time.Second

		// Create a new trade manager
		manager := web.New(cfg)

		// Subscribe to new offers
		sub := eventBus.Subscribe(&web.NewOfferEvent{})
		defer sub.Unsubscribe()

		fmt.Println("Trade manager initialized with poll interval:", manager.Count())
	}
